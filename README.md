# Overlook

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

This application is a hotel website that allows a user to log in, search for rooms by date and room type, book rooms, view their bookings, and view their total room costs based on their bookings.

### Installation Instructions:

2. Clone down the repo
3. Cd into the repo, run "npm install", and then run "npm start"
4. Visit the local server repo by clicking this link: https://github.com/turingschool-examples/overlook-api
5. Clone down the repo
6. Cd into the repo, run "npm install", and then run "npm start"
7. Access the website via: http://localhost:8080/
8. Enjoy the application!

Note: valid credentials are username = customer1 and password = overlook2021. If you would like to view alternative user accounts, you can use the same credentials above but simply change the # following the word 'customer' (e.g. customer7, customer16, customer35, etc. up through customer50).

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

This was a solo project. I completed the project over the course of 5 days (approximately 35 hours). A colleague performed two code reviews via pull requests. 

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

* Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
* Create a clear and accessible user interface
* Make network requests to retrieve data
* Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
* Write DRY, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

Wins:
* Implementation of successful network requests
* User error messaging for invalid credentials and invalid search dates
* Clean and accesible UI design

Challenges:
* Application responsiveness
